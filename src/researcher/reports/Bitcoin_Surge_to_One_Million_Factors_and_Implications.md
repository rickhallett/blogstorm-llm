            # Bitcoin's Potential Rise to One Million: A Strongman Analysis

## Introduction

Bitcoin, the world's first and most prominent cryptocurrency, has been a subject of intense speculation and debate since its inception. As of late 2024, Bitcoin has reached unprecedented heights, with predictions suggesting it could soar to one million dollars per Bitcoin. This report examines the factors that could favor such a rise, particularly focusing on the potential impact of U.S. government purchases of Bitcoin. The analysis draws from various sources to provide a comprehensive view of the situation.

## The Current Landscape

### Bitcoin's Recent Performance

Bitcoin has recently achieved significant milestones, reaching an all-time high of $100,000. This surge is attributed to several factors, including favorable macroeconomic conditions, increased institutional demand, and the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)). The approval of these ETFs has opened the doors for institutional investors, boosting Bitcoin's legitimacy and market presence ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)).

### Institutional and Sovereign Adoption

Institutional adoption is on the rise, with around 60 public companies holding Bitcoin in their treasuries. Sovereign adoption, though still nascent, is led by countries like Bhutan and El Salvador ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)). This trend indicates a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, which could drive its price further.

## The Role of the U.S. Government

### Strategic National Bitcoin Reserve

The idea of a U.S. government Bitcoin reserve has gained traction, with proposals suggesting the acquisition of 1 million Bitcoins over two decades without using taxpayer dollars ([Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/11/42220158/donald-trump-to-establish-a-national-bitcoin-reserve-pros-vs-cons-compared)). Proponents argue that such a reserve could help reduce national debt and counter global de-dollarization risks ([VanEck](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/digital-assets/matthew-sigel-vaneck-mid-december-bitcoin-chaincheck/)).

### Potential Impact on Bitcoin's Price

The establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve could significantly impact Bitcoin's price. Government purchases would reduce the available supply, potentially driving up prices due to increased demand ([Pro-Blockchain](https://pro-blockchain.com/en/bitcoin-to-hit-1-million-within-2-years-based-on-new-satoshi-action-fund-model)). This scenario aligns with the economic principle of supply and demand, where a fixed supply and increasing demand lead to higher prices.

## Factors Favoring Bitcoin's Rise

### Economic and Political Factors

1. **Pro-Crypto Policies**: The return of former President Donald Trump to office has brought pro-crypto policies, creating a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets ([KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/research/insights/bitcoin-price-prediction-2024-25-plan-b-forecasts-btc-at-1-million-by-2025)).

2. **Global Economic Conditions**: Favorable macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation and currency devaluation, have increased Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against traditional financial systems ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)).

### Technological Advancements

1. **Layer-2 Solutions**: The development of Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network has enabled faster and cheaper transactions, enhancing Bitcoin's usability and attractiveness ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)).

2. **Bitcoin Spot ETFs**: The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs has facilitated institutional investment, increasing Bitcoin's market legitimacy and adoption ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)).

### Market Dynamics

1. **Institutional Demand**: The growing interest from institutional investors is a significant driver of Bitcoin's price. These investors view Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)).

2. **Sovereign Adoption**: Countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender or as part of their reserves could further boost its price by increasing demand and reducing available supply ([Flush.com](https://flush.com/blog/post/bitcoin-price-hits-100k-unlocking-the-catalysts-that-could-lead-to-1-million)).

## Challenges and Risks

### Market Volatility

Bitcoin's price is notoriously volatile, which poses risks for both individual and institutional investors. Critics argue that government involvement could expose taxpayers to significant risks due to market fluctuations ([Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/11/42220158/donald-trump-to-establish-a-national-bitcoin-reserve-pros-vs-cons-compared)).

### Regulatory Concerns

The decentralized nature of Bitcoin raises concerns about regulatory oversight. Government ownership could challenge Bitcoin's ethos of decentralization, potentially leading to regulatory backlash ([BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/us-bitcoin-reserve-global-arms-race/)).

### Wealth Redistribution

A significant rise in Bitcoin's price could lead to wealth redistribution, benefiting early adopters at the expense of latecomers. This scenario could exacerbate social inequalities and lead to instability ([DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/blockchain-and-digital-assets-news-and-trends/2024/blockchain-and-digital-assets-news-and-trends-october-2024---december-2024)).

## Conclusion

The potential for Bitcoin to reach one million dollars is supported by a confluence of factors, including increased institutional and sovereign adoption, favorable economic conditions, and technological advancements. The U.S. government's potential involvement through a national Bitcoin reserve could further propel Bitcoin's price by reducing supply and increasing demand. However, this scenario is not without challenges, including market volatility, regulatory concerns, and social implications.

In conclusion, while the path to one million dollars per Bitcoin is fraught with uncertainties, the factors in favor of such a rise are compelling. The interplay of economic, political, and technological dynamics will be crucial in determining Bitcoin's future trajectory.

Governments’ aggregate decrease in BTC holdings from Q3 2024 to today can be primarily attributed to Germany’s selling of all ~50,000 BTC it had seized. At an average sales price of $57.6k, Germany’s BTC sale has reached a ~$2.5 billion opportunity cost when measured against December 17th’s price of ~108k per BTC. We believe the U.S. should avoid repeating Germany’s mistake. While critics like Peter Schiff have urged President Biden to sell the U.S.’s Bitcoin before Trump’s inauguration, a well-managed reserve could provide significant long-term value. The analysis below illustrates this potential. Modeling BITCOIN Act Scenarios We modeled outcomes based on the BITCOIN Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis.

The Act proposes that the U.S. Treasury acquire 1 million BTC over five years to counter rising inflation and global de-dollarization risks. However, even without legislation, there are several steps Trump could take via executive action to initiate such a reserve: Halt the sale of Bitcoin from the U.S. asset forfeiture reserve (~198k BTC). Revalue gold certificates—currently priced at 1970s levels—to today’s value, unlocking ~$693 billion in unrealized capital. Leverage the $49.7 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) under the authority of the Treasury Secretary. While the U.S. awaits a broader legislative framework for holding Bitcoin\n']
